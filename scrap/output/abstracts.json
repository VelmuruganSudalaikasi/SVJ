        "Objective": "The subtype distribution and clinical profile of Non‑Hodgkin’s Lymphoma (NHL) show a wide variation in the different geographical locations. There is paucity of data regarding this from Western India. This study was aimed to evaluate the clinical spectrum and distribution of NHL subtypes at a tertiary care hospital of Western India.",
        "Patients and Methods": "This prospective observational study was conducted over a period of 2 years among 178 NHL patients of all ages. Clinical evaluation and investigations including histopathological examination and immunohistochemistry of involved tissue, bone marrow examination, and other relevant tests were performed. Cases were categorized according to World Health Organization classification of tumours of lymphoid tissues (2017).",
        "Results": "There was a male preponderance (66.3%), and the commonest age group affected was 41-50 years (24.1%). The predominant symptom was neck swelling (51.1%), and the commonest sign was lymphadenopathy (70.2%), cervical lymph nodes being the most commonly involved (51.1%). Extra‑nodal involvement was seen in 37.6% patients, the head‑and‑neck being the most commonly involved site (16.3%). Majority of the NHLs were B-cell lymphomas (75.3%). Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma was the commonest subtype (36.5%) followed by peripheral T-cell lymphoma, not otherwise specified (10.7%). Pediatric NHL comprised of 11.2% of NHL, T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma (T-LBL) being the commonest subtype (25%).",
        "Conclusions": "Our analysis confirmed findings of various previous studies from India with few key differences. Mantle cell lymphoma had marginally higher frequency than follicular lymphoma, and was the second commonest B-cell NHL. Burkitt’s lymphoma had lower frequency than T-LBL in children, and was the second commonest childhood NHL."

        "Objective": "Multiple Myeloma (MM) is increasing in incidence and for the elderly, survival remains poor, mainly due to poor tolerance to chemotherapy which forms an important component of first-line treatment for MM. No previous study has been found on dexamethasone monotherapy for MM treatment.",
        "Case Presentation": "A 75-year-old female of Chinese descent, previously independent with a background of well-controlled hypertension, type 2 diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and mild Alzheimer’s dementia presented to the general practice with fatigue, left groin pain, decreased appetite and dizziness. She was diagnosed with end-stage MM based on serum protein electrophoresis and skeletal survey and treated with only dexamethasone as a chemotherapeutic agent.",
        "Results": "As of February 2022, two years after the diagnosis of end-stage MM and treatment with dexamethasone monotherapy and supportive therapy, the patient remains adherent to her management plan. She remained alive with mild functional decline and preserved renal function.",
        "Conclusions": "In addition to managing patients according to the best principles of supportive care, dexamethasone monotherapy may be a good alternative maintenance agent in frail, elderly patients with MM who may not even tolerate attenuated chemotherapy."

        "Objective": "Acute leukemia is a cancer of the blood and bone marrow. Due to chemotherapy drug side effects, the use ofnatural compounds is essential. The Cichorium intybus L. is a natural compound that shows antitumor and antioxidant effects in various cancerous cell lines. However, its impact on leukemic cells is ambiguous. The present study aimed to investigate the effect of the Cichorium extract, alone and in combination with Doxorubicin (DOX), on apoptosis induction in myeloid (NALM-6) and lymphoid (KG-1) cell lines.",
        "Materials and Methods": "Hydroalcoholic extract of Cichorium intybus L (C. intybus ) was prepared.",
        "Results": "Our results displayed that C. intybus could induce cytotoxic effects in KG-1, Nalm-6 cell with IC50 values of 400 ±1.7 and 275 ±5.6 µg/ml CIE has a significant apoptotic impact on Nalm-6 and KG-1 cell lines of ALL and AML in a dose and time-dependent manner (p<0.05). Real-time PCR results indicated a notable increase in BAX, CASPAS 3, 9 gene expression, and decreased BCL2 gene expression (p <0.05).",
        "Conclusions": "C. intybus, Dox, and their combination exerted a more potent apoptotic effect on the Nalm-6 cell line than the KG-1 cell line. Cichorium upgraded the cytotoxic effect of DOX on Nalm-6 and KG-1 cell lines and could be suggested as a chemotherapy supplement in acute leukemia."

        "Objective": "Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML) is a myeloproliferative disorder characterized by the chromosomal translocation t(9;22) encoding for the Bcr/Abl fusion gene. Secreted Frizzled Related Protein (sFRP) gene products are antagonists of Wnt signaling and their epigenetic silencing has been reported in different types of leukemia. While epigenetic silencing has been extensively reported for sFRP, sFRP4 is a family member less studied. We aimed to study epigenetic silencing of sFRP4 in CML patients.",
        "Patients and Methods": "Epigenetics alterations in the promoter region of the sFRP4 gene were analyzed in 43 CML patients. DNA methylation of CpGs in the sFRP4 promotor region was investigated using methylation specific PCR. Conventional cytogenetic analyzes were performed directly and after 24 h short cultures from bone marrow samples of patients with a preliminary diagnosis of CML.",
        "Results": "42 out of the 43 CML patients investigated were shown to be unmethylated at the sFRP4 promoter region, while in 1 patient hemimethylation was observed. This patient was the only one in which cytogenetic progression with additional chromosomal abnormalities were identified. All others achieved major or complete cytogenetic remission.",
        "Conclusions": "We observed that sFRP4 methylation is a very rare CML patients’ phenomenon. Yet when observed it may implicate disease progression and therapy resistance. A large study needs to clarify the implication of methylated sFRP4 in CML progression."

        "Objective": "Determination of absolute DNA concentration by Real-Time PCR is mandatory for an accurate molecular diagnosis. The critical step is a precise and reliable calibration curve. Plasmid DNA containing cloned target sequences is widely used as standards in quantitative PCR. Usually, the initial molecular number of plasmid molecules is deduced by theoretical calculation and this can be severely limiting the accuracy of PCR assay.",
        "Materials and Methods": "We have developed a simple method to generate a precise standard curve made of plasmid DNA by competitive PCR approach. The procedure is the following: i) construction of competitor fragment; ii) generation of the stock standard by cloning the DNA target template in the plasmid vector; iii) determination of the number of molecules in the stock standard by competitive PCR; iv) analytical validation of standard curve, in terms of accuracy, sensitivity and specificity. We have used this procedure to quantify the genetic marker breakpoint, the t(14;18), associated to Follicular Lymphoma (FL) of Non-Hodgkin’s Lymphomas (NHL).",
        "Results": "We found that the assessment of plasmid copy number, obtained by theoretical calculation, is overestimated compared to our competitive PCR approach (error of 22% +/-5). The standard plasmid DNA, used to generate the calibration curve, is stable and produces a high reproducible curve even after a long-term storage compared to genomic DNA curve.",
        "Conclusions": "The described procedure: i) generates robust standard curves for absolute quantification of any DNA target of interest; ii) is suitable with any molecular diagnostic platform; iii) contributes significantly to improve the accuracy of routine laboratory applications."

        "Objective": "The aim of this article is to summarize the main radiological evidences induced by multiple myeloma at the jaws level.",
        "Materials and Methods": "The analysis examines the main case reports and reviews on the matter. All relevant publications were searched through the PubMed search engine, using the following keywords: \"Multiple Myeloma\" and \"Radiological evidences\", \"Maxilla\", \"Jaw\", \"TMJ\". The purpose of our review is to highlight how oral radiological investigation is extremely useful in detecting any bone alterations associated with cases of multiple myeloma. In addition, we investigate the sites of the jaws where direct bone alteration is more frequently, and we perform a differential diagnosis with other focal alterations of the jaws or those that are the result of certain drug therapies (bisphosphonates). Our research stresses the concept that early diagnosis of multiple myeloma at the jaws level may prevent unnecessary and inadequate treatments.",
        "Results": "From the evaluation of our research, it is evident that osteolytic lesions are one of the fundamental signs of multiple myeloma, especially in areas undergoing intense hematopoietic activity. Among the radiological techniques used for diagnosis, the most sensitive one appears to be the three-dimensional technique, such as CT or Cone Beam, whereas two-dimensional radiographs (orthopantomography) appear to be exhaustive only when the lesion is very extensive.",
        "Conclusions": "It is evident that the dentist figure plays not only a supportive role, but also a fundamental part in the diagnostic process, as lesions that may anticipate a systemic manifestation are often encountered at the oral level."

        "Objective": "Multiple myeloma (MM) is a systemic disease characterized by pathological plasma cells that cause the gathering of carcinogenic cells in the bone marrow. Despite the development of new drugs and the use of herbal preparations as treatment support, MM remains untreatable. In this study, the cytotoxic and apoptotic effects of extracts of species of Vinca, Vinca herbacea Waldst. and Kit and Vinca soneri Koyuncu, on MM cell lines were investigated.",
        "Materials and Methods": "The WST-1 test was used to determine the antiproliferative effects at different doses and time intervals of the applied extracts on MM cells and real-time polymerase chain reaction, caspase enzyme activity, and flow cytometry techniques were used to reveal the apoptotic effects.",
        "Results": "As a general finding, it can be assumed that Vinca extracts may be a potential treatment for MM. The result of the WST-1 test revealed that Vinca extracts, especially that of V. herbacea, had time- and dose-dependent cytotoxic effects on MM cells. Moreover, an increase in proapoptotic gene expressions, such as BAX, BIK, p53, and casp3, and an increase in caspase 3 enzyme activity indicated that the extracts resulted in apoptosis of MM cells.",
        "Conclusions": "As a basic contribution, it was determined that extracts from species of Vinca have cytotoxic, apoptotic, and invasion inhibitory effects on MM cells."

        "Objective": "Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is characterized by the Philadelphia chromosome with an abnormally shortened chromosome 22, which is the result of a reciprocal translocation of chromosomes 9 and 22 that creates BCR-ABL fusion transcripts. CML accounts for approximately 15% of all leukemia cases and 24.3% of hematological disorders in Burkina Faso. The present study identified the main BCR-ABL fusion transcript variants using multiplex PCR in CML patients and investigated the hematological features at the time of diagnosis.",
        "Patients and Methods": "Total cellular RNA was extracted from 107 blood leukocytes using methods adapted from Chomczynsky and Sacchi (1987). A reverse transcription reaction was performed using a high capacity cDNA reverse transcription kit from Applied Biosystem (Ref 4368814) following the manufacturer’s instructions. BCR-ABL transcript types were investigated using a homemade PCR method that was adapted and optimized from published protocols. A single reaction with multiple primers was used in multiplex PCR to detect and investigate the type and frequency of CML in 41 enrolled patients.",
        "Results": "The average age of patients was 39 years and ranged between 12 and 65 years. Two main transcript types were identified in 38 of the 41 patients included in the study. The most common transcripts were b2a2 (47.4%) and b3a2 (34.2%). Eight samples (18.4%) presented both types of transcripts. During the diagnosis, the average hemoglobin level, average white blood cell number and platelets in newly diagnosed CML patients were 8.3 g/dL; 270.1 G/L and 350.2 G/L, respectively.",
        "Conclusions": "Multiplex-PCR allowed for the rapid, specific and simultaneous detection of the most frequent BCR-ABL variant transcripts. The present study showed a higher frequency of b2a2 than b3a2 transcripts in Burkina Faso CML patients. These findings will guide us in the choice of specific BCR-ABL variant primers for the monitoring of patients undergoing Imatinib treatment."
